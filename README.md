## Contents

- **Data Collection and Aggregation**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset.
- **Rule-Based Systems**: ID3 decision tree implementation, forward chaining, and backward chaining.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network design, implementation, and evaluation.
- **Reports**: Detailed analysis and project reports.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for different parts of the project.
- `src/`: Python scripts for implementation.
- `reports/`: Project reports and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Features

1. **Data Collection and Aggregation**:
   - Ensures accuracy and completeness of the dataset.

2. **Rule-Based Systems**:
   - ID3 Decision Tree for rule extraction.
   - Forward and backward chaining implementations.

3. **Deep Learning**:
   - Neural network design and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
